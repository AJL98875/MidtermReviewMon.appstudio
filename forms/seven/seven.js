DO yourself or with partner 

Write a program to calculate debt-to-income ratio using a 
function and controls (no prompt, alert, console.log, etc).
   
   Use these controls: Bootstrap4 button(s), label(s), input(s), 
    and one control of your choice.We will assume the user has 
    only 3 debts - get these: 
          
    > monthly car payment
    > monthly rent payment
    > monthly credit card payment
    
Get the user gross monthly income.

Create a function that takes four arguments (the 3 debts, 
the gross monthly income) and returns the debt-to-income 
ratio to the calling module using this formula:

   (sum of the monthly debt payments/gross monthly income) x 100
   
Display the answer outside of the function in a control. 
Eg. Say you have these numbers from the user: 
    Car payment:           $150/month
    Rent payment:          $550/month
    Credit Card Payment:   $250/month
    Gross Income:          $2500/month
    In this case the debt to income ratio would be 38%

function debtToIncome(r,cc,ca,gi) {
  
  return ((r+cc+ca)/gi) *100
  

btnSubmit.onclick=function(){
    lblAnswer.value = debtToIncome( Number(inptRent.value), Number(inptCreditCard.value), Number(inptCar.value), Number(inptGrossIncome.value))
  
}
